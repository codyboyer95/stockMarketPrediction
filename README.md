### Weather Data ###
To retrieve weather data in a pandas datafram with csv file, install package:
```
pip install pandas wwo-hist
```
Go into get_weather_data.py and change the file location and dates (if desired)

Then run this from terminal:
```
python get_weather_data.py
```

It will put the data into a pandas datafram and also export a file (with the same data) named "new_york_city.csv" that you can use for analysis.
